Churn prediction is identifying customers that are most likely to live a service. This is important for most companies as acquiring new customers is more costlier than retaining old ones, So the results of Churn prediction help companies focus on customers that are likely to churn and develop strategies for retaining those customers.

Here I worked with E Commerce Customer Dataset gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction). 
* I explored the data by creating visualizations, calculating statistical summaries.
* After exploration, I preprocessed the data which involved
    * Encoding Categorical variables
    * Imputing missing values
* Finally, I built the model using Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost
