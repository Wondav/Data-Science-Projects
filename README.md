Churn prediction is identifying customers that are most likely to live a service. This is important for most companies as acquiring new customers is more costlier than retaining old ones, So the results of Churn prediction help companies focus on customers that are likely to churn and develop strategies for retaining those customers.

Here I worked with E Commerce Customer Dataset gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction). 
* I explored the data by creating visualizations, calculating statistical summaries.
* After exploration, I preprocessed the data which involved
    * Encoding Categorical variables
    * Imputing missing values
* Finally, I built the model using Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost

Recommender systems in a very general way operate by suggesting the most likely thing a user want to receive next to a user. It helps companies in retaining customers on platforms, and increasing customer lifetime value. By looking at users history on your platform, you are able to profile them and give them recommendations based on that profile
